# Mininet-Topologies
This topologies are created for testing/analysis for my thesis work.

In this project, I have tested several packets/protocols in 4 different topologies(tree,star,linear and hybrid).

I have extracted all data and generated graphs by gnuplot tool.

Repository also includes the source code of each topology.
